## Branching Procedures

1. **Create/Take an Issue:**
   - Create or take an issue from the GitHub Project board.

2. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Switch to the `dev-back` branch and pull the recent changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout dev-back
     git pull origin dev-back
     ```
   - Create a new branch from `dev-back`:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b <branch-name>
     ```

3. **Keeping Your Branch Updated:**
   - Regularly pull changes from the `dev-back` branch to keep your branch updated:
     ```bash
     git checkout dev-back
     git pull origin dev-back
     git checkout <your-branch>
     git merge dev-back
     ```

## Branch Naming Rules

1. **Feature Branches:**
   - Use the `feature/` prefix for adding, refactoring, or removing a feature.
   - Format: `feature/issue-number-description`
   - Example: `feature/123/add-authentication`

2. **Bug Fix Branches:**
   - Use the `bugfix/` prefix for fixing a bug.
   - Format: `bugfix/issue-number/description`
   - Example: `bugfix/456/fix-login-error`

3. **Hotfix Branches:**
   - Use the `hotfix/` prefix for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency).
   - Format: `hotfix/issue-number/description`
   - Example: `hotfix/789/patch-vulnerability`

4. **Test Branches:**
   - Use the `test/` prefix for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket.
   - Format: `test/issue-number/description`
   - Example: `test/101/experiment-auth-module`

For more details on branch naming conventions, you can refer to [this guide](https://dev.to/varbsan/a-simplified-convention-for-naming-branches-and-commits-in-git-il4).

## Commit Naming Rules and Frequency

1. **Commit Message Format:**
   - Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
   - Use the following format for commit messages:
     ```
     <type>[optional scope]: <description>
     ```
   - Types can include: `feat` (feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `style` (formatting, missing semi colons, etc.), `refactor` (refactoring code), `test` (adding missing tests), `chore` (updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.).

   - Examples:
     ```
     feat: add user authentication
     ```

     ```
     fix(auth): resolve login error
     ```

     ```
     refactor(auth): simplify authentication module
     ```

     ```
     docs(readme): update contribution guidelines
     ```

2. **Frequency:**
   - Commit frequently to ensure that your work is saved and changes are smaller and easier to review.
   - Aim for small, focused commits that do one thing well.

## Pull Request (PR) Rules and Procedure

1. **Creating a Pull Request:**
   - Push your branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```
   - Go to the repository on GitHub and create a new Pull Request from your branch to the `dev-back` branch.
   - Change the base branch from `main` to `dev-back`.

2. **PR Body:**
   - In the PR body, provide a clear and concise description of what has been done.
   - Include **detailed testing instructions** for testing the changes in Postman.
   - Example:
     ### What has been done
     - Added JWT-based authentication for user login and registration.
     - Refactored the authentication module to improve readability and performance.
     
     ### Testing Instructions
     1. Open Postman.
     2. Make a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/register` with the following JSON body:**
        ```json
        {
          "email": "test@example.com",
          "password": "Password123!"
        }
        ```
     3. Verify that you receive a JWT token in the response.
     4. Make a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/api/user/profile` with the JWT token in the Authorization header:**
        ```
        Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
        ```
     5. Verify that you receive the user's profile information.**

3. **Request Reviews:**
   - Request reviews from all relevant team members or people working on the feature.
   - Before merging ensure that at least one developer runs your code, checks it, and provides feedback.

4. **Merging PRs:**
   - Ensure all checks pass.

5. **Delete Branch:**
   - After merging the PR, delete the branch both locally and remotely:
     ```bash
     git branch -d <branch-name>
     git push origin --delete <branch-name>
     ```

## Guidelines to Solve Merge Conflicts

1. **Identify Conflicts:**
   - When you encounter a merge conflict, Git will highlight the conflicting files.
   - Use the following command to see the status of your conflicts:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

2. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   - Open the conflicting files and look for the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
   - Manually resolve the conflicts by choosing the correct code or combining both changes as needed.
   - After resolving conflicts, mark the file as resolved:
     ```bash
     git add <conflicted-file>
     ```

3. **Continue the Merge:**
   - Once all conflicts are resolved and added, continue with the merge:
     ```bash
     git commit
     ```

4. **Update Your Branch:**
   - If you solved conflicts on GitHub, pull the changes to ensure everything works as intended:
     ```bash
     git pull origin <branch-name>
     ```

5. **Prevent Future Conflicts:**
   - Regularly pull changes from the `dev-back` branch to keep your branch up to date:
     ```bash
     git pull origin dev-back
     ```

For more details on resolving merge conflicts, you can refer to [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts).

## Guidelines for Reviews

1. **Code Quality:**
   - Ensure the code follows the team's coding standards and guidelines.
   - Check for proper indentation, naming conventions, and code readability.

2. **Functionality:**
   - Verify that the code works as intended by running it locally.
   - Ensure that all new features or bug fixes are properly tested.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Ensure that the code is well-documented.
   - Check that any new functions or classes have appropriate comments and documentation.

4. **Feedback:**
   - Provide constructive feedback and suggest improvements if needed.
   - Be respectful and considerate in your comments.

5. **Approval:**
   - If the code meets all requirements and standards, approve the pull request.
   - If there are issues, request changes and provide clear instructions on what needs to be fixed.
